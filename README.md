# Data-Mining
This repository contains the project "Collaborative clustering" done during the course Data Mining at the University of Windsor in summer 2018.

Clustering is an unsupervised classification process of partitioning a set of data according to their similarities. Clustering results on the same data set can vary by using different clustering methods. The goal of this project is to produce common cluters by collaborating several clustering results.The goal of this project is to produce common clusters through the collaboration of several clustering results. Here, A data set is taken as input and partitioned into clusters, using multiple K-means clustering method by varying the parameters.

The visualization of the clusters resulted from different clustering methods has been observed as the final result.
